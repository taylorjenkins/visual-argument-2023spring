Fast Fashion Leads to Slow Destruction

My digital image project is meant to bring awareness to the harmful effects of fast fashion. 
It affects multiple aspects of our environment and society - ranging our oceans, food supply/chain, our air and our work force. 
I opted to portray the harmful effects of fast fashion as a new part of the globe, replacing oceans and pieces of land, to show how massive of an impact this industry has on Earth.
I found it difficult to integrate these pieces at first, but used the selection and lasso effects to create the image of the globe you see.
I wanted to also bring light to some quick, but interesting facts that can show the specific impacts of fast fashion.
