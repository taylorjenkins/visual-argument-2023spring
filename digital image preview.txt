In my project, I have decided to highlight the multiple ways that fast fashion harms our Earth. When researching the topic, I found that fast fashion is harmful to our oceans, landfills, food supply, air and our work force for those companies that choose to use sweatshops to manufacture thousands of items daily. I wanted to portray the images within our globe to show how they happen internationally, not just in one place. I tried to layer them underneath the actual globe image I chose using the lasso and quick selection tools. 
I put the title around the globe and then added the facts that I wanted to include in my image, but I’m not sure about the font/placement yet, so if you have any suggestions, I would appreciate them! The QR code also takes you to an actual website that directs you to an informational website about fast fashion effects.
